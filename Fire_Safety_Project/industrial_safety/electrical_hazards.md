# Electrical Hazards in Industrial Environments

**Common Sources**
- Overloaded circuits, poor earthing, damaged insulation
- Arcing faults, improper lockout-tagout (LOTO), moisture ingress
- Inadequate IP-rated enclosures in harsh areas

**Controls**
- Proper breaker sizing, RCD/GFCI usage
- Routine thermography/IR scans, insulation testing
- LOTO procedures; PPE: arc-rated clothing, gloves, face shield
- Separation of power and control wiring; cable management

**Fire Link**
- Electrical faults are a frequent ignition source. Pair ELCB/RCD + smoke/heat detectors.
